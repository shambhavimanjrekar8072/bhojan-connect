        <p>At Bhojan Connect, we believe no meal should go to waste while someone goes hungry. Our mission is to bridge the gap between surplus food and those who need it most. We provide a platform where generous individuals, restaurants, and organizations can donate excess food to registered food banks. People in need can then easily find and collect this food, ensuring that every meal reaches the right hands.
Through connection, compassion, and community, Bhojan Connect strives to reduce food wastage, fight hunger, and create a more sustainable world â€” one meal at a time.</p>
